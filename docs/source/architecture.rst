Architecture
============

The system is divided into two parts— :doc:`src.CARLA` and :doc:`src.FMOD`. The Carla part essentially handles the setup of and communication with the Carla simulator. The FMOD part handles sound playback.

1. Carla
--------

The **CARLA part** is responsible for connecting to the Carla simulator and providing the **simulation data** that is later used by the FMOD subsystem for audio playback. Technically, it consists of a lightweight client that connects to the running Carla server, locates/monitors the "hero" vehicle reads relevant state information, and **periodically sends it via UDP as JSON** to a local receiver.

Folder structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``cmain.py``: Entry point for the Carla client. Starts the data loop (polling simulation values) and sends data packets at a fixed interval. It also launches a small weather UI to adjust weather parameters during runtim.
* ``Classes/``: Contains the cor calsses for connecting, sensing, data transport, and UI:

    * ``__init__.py``: Exposes the main classes as package imports.
    * ``CarlaClient.py``: Encapsulates the Carla server connection, retrieves the ``world``, searches for a vehicle, and continuously reads vehicle and environment data. It also attaches a collision sensor and produces a compact data packet (relevant for the sound logic).
    * ``CollisionSensor.py``: Implements a Carla collision sensor that counts collisions and measures their intensity, used to trigger crash events.
    * ``Socket.py``: Minimal UDP wrapper for sending JSON data (locally to 127.0.0.1 on a fix port)
    * ``Weather.py``: Small Tkinter GUI used to set rain and wind intensity in the running simulation.

* ``generate_traffic.py``: Script to generate traffic in the simulator.
* ``requirements.txt``: Python dependencies that are required for the Carla client (will be installed into a venv).

Data flow
~~~~~~~~~

1. ``cmain.py`` starts the client and the sender loop.
2. ``CarlaClient`` connects to the simulator, finds the ego/hero vehicle, and attaches a ``CollisionSensor``.
3. At short intervals, it reads relevant states (vehicle motion/control, speed/speed limit, wheather, events like collisions/honk)
4. ``Socket`` serializes the values as JSON and sends them via UDP to the local receiver (:doc:`src.FMOD.utils`).

**Goal of this module:**
Provide a robust and easily extensible interface between the Carla simulation and the sound system, without embedding sound logic directly inside the Carla side.

2. FMOD
-------

The **FMOD part** handles the actual **sound logic and audio playback**. It receives data packets sent by the Carla client (UDP/JSON), detects changes (diffing), and translates these changes into **FMOD event triggers**, **parameter updates**, or **procedurally generated sounds**. The structure is loosely based on an **MVC-style** split: *Model* (data receiving/processing), *Adapters* (logic), and *Banks/Sounds* (audio resources and playback).

Folder structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``fmain.py``: Entry point of the FMOD subsystem. Initializes:

    * the central ``EventBus`` (publisher-subscriber),
    * FMOD ``Banks`` (loading/initializing FMOD Studio events),
    * ``Adapters`` (sound logic reacting to data changes),
    * and the ``SoundModel`` (UDP receive & diffing).

    Then it runs a loop that regularly processes new data and ticks trigger/one-shot logic.

* ``Model/``

    * ``SoundModel.py``: **Receives** Carla data via UDP, **decodes** the JSON, and computes the **difference** to the previous state. Only changed values are published via the ``EventBus``. This reduces unnecessary sound updates and cleanly separates data handling from sound logic.

* ``utils/``

    * ``EventBus.py``: Lightweight event bus enabling loose coupling between publishers (model) and subscribers (adapters).
    * ``DataKey.py``: Central definition of all data keys (Enum). Ensures consistent keys, avoids typos, and supports easy extension.
    * ``RangeLevel.py``: Utility for mapping continuous values (e.g., intensities) to discrete levels.

* ``Adapters/`` (controller/adaper layer): Components that **subscribe** to specific ``DataKeys`` and translate changes into audio actions.

    * ``EnvironmentAdapter.py``: Updates environment parameters (e.g., rain/wind) as FMOD parameters on continuously running events. Includes mapping from continuous intensities to levels (``RainIntensity``/``WindIntensity``).
    * ``MotorAdapter.py``: Handles engine/vehicle sounds. Instead of relying only on FMOD Studio events, it controls a procedural EV sound generator (parameters: speed/throttle → estimated “torque”).
    * ``TriggerAdapter.py``: Handles one-shot/trigger sounds such as crash, honk, handbrake, and reverse warning. Contains simple gating/state logic to prevent double-triggering in noisy input scenarios.
    * ``RainIntensity.py``/``WindIntensity.py``: Define intensity ranges as discrete levels (NONE/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) that are mapped to parameter values.

* ``Banks/`` (FMOD Studio interface): Encapsulates **loading FMOD bank files**, creating event instances, and calling ``studio_system.update()``:

    * ``EnvironmentBank.py``: Initializes FMOD Studio, loads the relevant bank, and provides instances for rain/wind (including parameter control).
    * ``TriggerBank.py``: Loads the trigger bank and exposes methods like ``play_*()`` for warning/crash/honk/handbrake.
    * ``MotorBank.py``: Placeholder/design stub for a dedicated motor bank (the motor sound is currently handled mainly via ``Sounds/EVSund.py``).

* ``Sounds/`` (procedural audio)

    * ``EVSund.py``: Generates EV/vehicle sounds procedurally using DSP oscillators, filters, and parameterized volume/frequency control based on speed and load.
    * ``ReverseBeep.py``: Procedurally generated reverse beep (short tone/pattern) as an alternative or supplement to FMOD Studio events.

* ``requirements.txt``: Python dependencies that are required for the Carla client (will be installed into a venv).

.. _data_flow_fmod:

Data flow
~~~~~~~~~

1. **``fmain.py`` boots the FMOD subsystem**: It creates the central ``EventBus``, initializes the required FMOD components (``Banks`` and procedural ``Sounds``), instantiates the ``Adapters`` that subscribe to data changes, and finally starts the ``SoundModel`` (UDP receiver).
2. **``SoundModel`` receives Carla data via UDP**: The model listens on a local UDP socket, decodes incoming JSON packets, and keeps the previous packet as a reference state.
3. **Diffing: only changes are published**: For each new packet, the model computes a diff against the last state. Only changed values are converted to ``DataKeys`` and published on the ``EventBus``.
4. **Adapters react to published updates**:

    * **Continuous values** (e.g., speed, throttle, rain/wind intensity) are translated into parameter updates (FMOD parameters or DSP/procedural sound parameters).
    * **Trigger-like values** (e.g., collision, honk, reverse gear, handbrake) are handled with gating/state logic to avoid duplicate triggers and then played as one-shot sounds.

5. **FMOD engine is kept alive via regular updates**: Within the main loop in ``fmain.py``, the system processes model updates (publishing changes) and ticks adapter/bank update functions so FMOD event playback and procedural audio remain responsive and in sync.
