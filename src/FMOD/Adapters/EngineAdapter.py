    Adapter responsible for synchronizing vehicle dynamics with the EV sound engine.

    This class subscribes to simulation data from the EventBus (speed and throttle)

    It ensures that engine sounds react dynamically to the driver's input and 
    vehicle state.

    Attributes:
        ev (EVSoundEngine): The engine responsible for generating electric 
            vehicle sounds.
        speed (float): The current velocity of the vehicle in km/h.
