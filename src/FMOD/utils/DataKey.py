    Enumeration of simulation data keys used for system-wide communication.

    This class defines the standardized keys used by the :class:`SoundModel` 
    to identify simulation variables received from the CARLA client. By 
    inheriting from ``str``, these members act as validated constants that 
    ensure consistency between the network layer, the EventBus, and the 
    various sound adapters.
